# esrm-portal
This is source code for the University of Houston's (UH) ESRM portal. The development of the ESRM portal has been funded by NSF Grant #1726968. 

The ESRM portal is a portal for the collection, analysis and appropriate sharing of data related to the Environmental Sampling Research Module (ESRM). The ESRM was developed initially as part of the UH biotechnology program. The laboratory curriculum was developed in collaboration with industry and academic partners and uses an organophosphorous-degrading bacterium, Brevundimonas diminuta, as an anchor organism to demonstrate the lifecycle of a typical biotechnology product and provides a framework to integrate the cross disciplinary skills. 

The ESRM portal utilizes Drupal 8 as the basis for the portal and will develop appropriate custom modules, for which this will be the public repository.
